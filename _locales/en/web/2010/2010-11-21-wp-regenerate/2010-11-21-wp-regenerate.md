_A new version of the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin is available, including some improvements from one of my personal projects._

<!-- more -->

Last time I changed my blog's theme, I discovered that it was impossible to regenerate Media Library images' thumbnails without a plugin. There was a plugin called [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) which resized all the images but it did not meet my needs. So I decided to improve and enhance it with error handling, a button that will allow you to abort the process, some log information, the possibility to regenerate a single image from the Media pageâ€¦ and I proposed [my modifications](https://github.com/borisschapira/RegenThumbs-Stamina "Github Repository of RegenThumbs Stamina, a temporary fork of the plugin Regenerate Thumbnails in order to develop new features") to the plugin's author, [Alex M. aka Viper007Bond](http://www.viper007bond.com), a developper who works for Automattic, the company well-known for its contributions to Wordpress and its free blogging network Wordpress.com. Alex decided to[ include some of them and redevelop the others](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/314024 "Regenerate Thumbnails 2.1.0 Changeset") to improve [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) even more. Try it&nbsp;!
